# Review Criteria Reference

Shared scoring rubrics, quality checklists, and skill-specific rubrics for AI-DLC documentation and implementation review. Used by `/aidlc-review` and `/aidlc-verify`.

---

## Part 1: Shared Foundations

### 1.1 Scoring Scale

All dimensions use a 0-100 scale.

| Range | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | High confidence | Solid work, minor issues only |
| 60-79 | Concerns | Notable issues that should be resolved |
| 0-59 | Significant issues | Substantial rework needed |

### 1.2 Confidence Thresholds

| Level | Score | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **High** | 80-100 | Proceed — documentation or implementation is solid |
| **Medium** | 60-79 | Address gaps — notable issues to resolve before proceeding |
| **Low** | <60 | Stop — substantial rework needed before continuing |

### 1.3 Finding Severity Levels

| Severity | Definition | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Blocking** | Must fix before merge/approval. Correctness, security, or data safety issue. | SQL injection, missing auth check, AC not implemented |
| **High** | Should fix before merge. Quality or reliability concern. | Missing error handling, untested AC, N+1 query |
| **Medium** | Improve in this MR or follow-up. Maintainability or best practice. | Poor naming, missing edge case test, inconsistent style |
| **Low** | Consider improving. Nice-to-have. | Minor style preference, optional refactoring opportunity |

### 2.2 Vague Language Patterns

Flag and deduct points for any of the following patterns:

| Pattern | Example | Remediation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Open-ended scope** | "and more features", "etc.", "various improvements" | Define explicit boundaries |
| **Untestable criteria** | "should be fast", "user-friendly", "secure" | Add measurable targets |
| **Missing specifics** | "connects to backend" without naming APIs/services | Identify specific APIs/services |
| **Boilerplate content** | Sections copied without customisation | Rewrite with project-specific detail |
| **Unmeasurable NFRs** | "good performance", "high availability" | Add specific targets (see 2.3) |
| **Undefined scope** | "the system should handle X" — which system? | Clarify system boundaries |
| **Unclear referents** | Pronouns with unclear referents in technical context | Use explicit names |

### 2.3 NFR Measurability Criteria

NFRs must include measurable targets. Flag NFRs that do not meet this standard.

| NFR Category | Bad (unmeasurable) | Good (measurable) |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Performance | "should be fast" | "API response <200ms p95" |
| Availability | "high availability" | "99.9% uptime, <5min recovery" |
| Security | "must be secure" | "OWASP Top 10 mitigated, encrypted at rest with AES-256" |
| Scalability | "should scale" | "Support 10k concurrent users with <10% latency increase" |
| Reliability | "reliable system" | "Zero data loss on failover, RPO=0, RTO<15min" |

Baselines should be documented where possible (current performance vs. target).

### 2.4 Accuracy and Consistency Checks

Apply these checks across all documents in scope:

- **Terminology consistency** — same terms used across documents for the same concepts
- **Scope alignment** — Unit scope matches Intent scope; no scope creep or gaps
- **AC consistency** — Task AC aligns with Unit/Bolt scope
- **Dependency consistency** — referenced items exist in other documents
- **NFR consistency** — targets don't contradict across documents
- **Contradiction detection** — identify statements in one document that conflict with another

## Part 3: Skill-Specific Rubrics

### 3.1 Documentation Review Rubric (aidlc-review Path A)

5 dimensions. Use with `/aidlc-review` Path A.

#### Completeness (weight: 25%)

| Score Range | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| 90-100 | All required sections present, thorough coverage, no gaps |
| 70-89 | Most sections present, minor gaps that don't block understanding |
| 50-69 | Several sections missing or incomplete |
| 0-49 | Major sections missing, document is a skeleton |

Apply Document Completeness Checklists from **Part 2.1** for the relevant document type.

#### Quality (weight: 25%)

| Score Range | Criteria |

### 3.3 Verification Readiness Rubric (aidlc-verify)

Used by `/aidlc-verify` to assess whether documentation is ready for AI execution and Jira transfer.

#### Main Assessment Categories

| Category | Weight | Criteria |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Intent Clarity** | 20% | Problem/scope/outcomes clearly defined, no vague language |
| **Task Completeness** | 25% | All Tasks have testable acceptance criteria |
| **Design Readiness** | 25% | Domain model documented, patterns chosen, ADRs for key decisions |
| **NFR Coverage** | 15% | Measurable targets (not "fast", "secure"), baselines documented |
| **Dependency Mapping** | 15% | Integration points identified, APIs/services listed, sequencing clear |

#### Sub-agent Scoring Dimensions

Sub-agents score each Unit on these 6 dimensions (0-100 each):

1. **Scope Clarity**
   - Is the Unit scope bounded? (no "and more", "etc.", vague outcomes)
   - Are deliverables specific and measurable?
   - Deduct points for open-ended language (see Part 2.2)

2. **Task Quality**
   - Do all Tasks have acceptance criteria?
   - Are acceptance criteria testable (not vague)?
   - Are Tasks in proper "As a... I want... So that..." format?
   - Apply Task Page checklist from Part 2.1

3. **Technical Readiness**
   - Are integration points identified (APIs, services, databases)?
   - Are data models or schemas referenced?
   - Are error handling expectations documented?

4. **NFR Specificity**
   - Are performance targets measurable (e.g., <200ms, not "fast")?
   - Are security requirements specific?
   - Are availability/reliability targets defined?
   - Apply NFR Measurability Criteria from Part 2.3

5. **Dependency Clarity**
   - Are blockers and prerequisites documented?
   - Is sequencing clear (what comes first)?
   - Are external dependencies identified?

6. **Bolt Grouping Quality**
   - Are Tasks grouped into cohesive Bolts?
   - Does each Bolt have a clear scope (hours to days)?
   - Are there no circular dependencies between Bolts?
   - Are bolt-to-bolt dependencies explicitly identified?
   - Is a Bolt Execution Plan with phases and lanes documented?
   - Are independent Bolts assigned to parallel lanes within the same phase?
   - Is each Bolt appropriately sized? (< 2h = overhead; > 3d = risk)
   - Is a critical path identified?
   - Are parallelism opportunities documented (teams needed per phase)?

#### Gap Categories

When identifying gaps, categorise them:

| Gap Type | Example | Remediation |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Vague scope** | "and more features" | Define explicit boundaries |
| **Missing AC** | Task without acceptance criteria | Add testable conditions |
| **Unmeasurable NFR** | "should be fast" | Add specific target (e.g., <200ms) |
| **Unknown integration** | "connects to backend" | Identify specific APIs/services |
| **Missing design** | No domain model | Run `/aidlc-design` |
| **Poor Bolt grouping** | Tasks span unrelated areas | Regroup into cohesive Bolts |
| **Missing bolt dependencies** | No dependency or parallelism analysis | Create Bolt Execution Plan with phases, lanes, critical path |
| **Missing execution plan** | No phased execution plan | Generate Bolt Execution Plan with Phase/Lane structure |
| **Oversized Bolt** | Bolt estimated > 3 days | Split into smaller Bolts |
| **Undersized Bolt** | Bolt estimated < 2 hours | Merge with related Bolt |
| **Circular dependency** | Bolts have circular dependency chain | Restructure into a DAG |

#### Bolt Grouping Quality Scoring Guide

| Score Range | Criteria |
|-------------|----------|
| 90-100 | Full Bolt Execution Plan with phases, lanes, critical path, parallelism table. All dependencies explicit. Bolts sized 2h-3d. No circular deps. |
| 70-89 | Dependencies identified, phases assigned, but missing critical path or parallelism analysis. Minor sizing issues. |
| 50-69 | Dependencies partially identified. No phased execution plan. Some bolts over/under-sized. |
| 0-49 | No dependency analysis. Bolts listed without sequencing. Sizing inappropriate. |

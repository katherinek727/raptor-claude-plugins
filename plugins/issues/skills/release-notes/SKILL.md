# Release Notes

Compose release notes by analyzing commits since the latest tag, cross-referencing with GitLab MRs and Jira issues.

## Prerequisites

- Atlassian MCP for fetching Jira ticket context
- GitLab MCP for fetching MR details
- Git access to origin/master and origin/main branches

## Instructions

### Step 1: Find the Latest Tag

Run these commands:
- git fetch --tags
- git describe --tags --abbrev=0

Store the result as LATEST_TAG.

### Step 2: Fetch Remote Branches

Run: git fetch origin master main

### Step 3: Get Commits Since Last Tag

Get merge commits from both branches:

From origin/main since the tag:
  git log LATEST_TAG..origin/main --merges --pretty=format:"%H|%s" --first-parent

From origin/master since the tag (these are hotfixes, already released):
  git log LATEST_TAG..origin/master --merges --pretty=format:"%H|%s" --first-parent

### Step 4: Exclude Already-Released Hotfixes

IMPORTANT: Commits in origin/master are hotfixes that have already been released. These must be excluded entirely from the release notes.

1. Collect all commit messages from origin/master (the hotfixes)
2. Remove any commits from origin/main that have identical messages to the hotfixes
3. Only the remaining origin/main commits should be included in release notes

This ensures we don't duplicate changes that were already released as hotfixes.

### Step 5: Extract MR Information from Merge Commits

For each merge commit, extract the MR IID from the commit message:

- GitLab merge commits typically have format: Merge branch 'branch-name' into 'main'
- Or: See merge request raptortech1/raptor/cpoms/cpoms!1234

Extract the MR IID (the number after the exclamation mark).

### Step 6: Look Up GitLab MRs

For each merge commit, fetch the MR details using GitLab MCP:

  mcp__gitlab__get_merge_request with:
  - project_id: raptortech1/raptor/cpoms/cpoms
  - merge_request_iid: the MR IID

This returns:
- title: MR title (often contains Jira key like AI-1234 Feature name)
- description: MR description (may contain Jira references)
- source_branch: Branch name (fallback for Jira key)

### Step 7: Extract Jira Issue Keys (Priority Order)

Extract Jira issue keys in this priority order:

1. MR Title - Look for pattern like XX-\d+ in the title (highest priority)
2. MR Description - Search for XX-\d+ patterns in the description
3. Source Branch - Extract from branch name like XX-1234-feature-name (fallback)

Use the first match found. Do NOT assume any key is invalid - always look up every key found to verify it exists.

### Step 8: Look Up Jira Issues (Use Subagent)

IMPORTANT: To avoid context bloat, use the Task tool with a subagent to look up Jira issues.

For each unique Jira issue key, spawn a subagent with subagent_type "general-purpose" and prompt:

  Look up Jira issue ISSUE_KEY using the Atlassian MCP tool.
  Use mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue with cloudId 7c795d89-53db-46c0-896a-d6333239676d and issueIdOrKey set to the issue key.
  Return ONLY these fields in this exact format:
  KEY: issue key
  TYPE: issue type name (Story, Bug, Chore, Spike, etc.)
  TITLE: summary/title
  DESCRIPTION: first 200 chars of description, or No description

You can run multiple subagents in parallel for efficiency.

### Step 9: Categorize Changes

Group issues by their Jira issue type, but use judgement for items without Jira links:

- Features: Story issue type, OR any change that adds new functionality (e.g., new API endpoints, new UI features)
- Bugfixes: Bug issue type - Defect fixes, corrections
- Other Changes: Chore, Spike, Task, internal tooling, documentation, dev workflow improvements

### Step 10: Format Release Notes

Generate markdown with this structure, wrapped in a code block (```markdown) so it renders correctly:

```markdown
## Release Notes - VERSION/TAG

### Features
- Jira issue title here [[AI-1234](https://raptortech1.atlassian.net/browse/AI-1234)]

### Bugfixes
- Jira issue title here [[AR-1236](https://raptortech1.atlassian.net/browse/AR-1236)]

### Other Changes
- Jira issue title here [[AR-1237](https://raptortech1.atlassian.net/browse/AR-1237)]
- MR title here [`branch-name` (!1234)]
```

## Formatting Guidelines

- **Use Jira titles directly**: Don't heavily rewrite issue names. Use the Jira title as-is or with minimal tweaks for clarity.
- **Link at end**: Put the linked issue key at the end in double brackets: `Title [[AI-1234](url)]`
- **No Jira link**: If an MR has no associated Jira issue (or the key doesn't exist), use branch name + MR number at the end (no link): `MR title [`branch-name` (!1234)]`
- **Deduplicate**: If multiple MRs reference the same Jira issue, combine them into one bullet

## Data Sources Priority

When composing the release note text for each item:

1. Jira issue title - Use directly, avoid rewriting unless unclear
2. MR title - Use as fallback if no Jira issue, or to clarify if Jira title is vague
3. Jira issue type - Use for categorization (Story → Features, Bug → Bugfixes, etc.)

## Tips

- Run Jira lookups in parallel (up to 5 at a time) to speed up the process
- Always verify Jira keys exist - never assume a key is invalid based on prefix
- Skip automated/bot commits (version bumps, CI updates) unless significant
- Group related small changes when they share a theme
